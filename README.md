# Python - Movie Booking Application

This program uses the Tkinter package to create a booking portal for feature films that are played in cinemas. Users of this application will be able to book a specific film based on a genre for a specific time slot. Available seats within the theaters will appear in green, selected screens will appear in blue and booked/occupied seats will be coloured in brown with a sunken effect to denote that the seat has been reserved.
